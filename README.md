## Timeline
I wanted to provide a breakdown of the events that occurred during the month of June 2023, leading up to the completion of this project.

Balancing summer school courses and exams, I aimed to work on a small and manageable project. This led me to create The Giving Tree: A story-based interactive horror game.

- During the UOttawa Game Dev club game night on **June 1st**, we were notified that the upcoming theme for the next jam would be **'Nature Strikes Back.'** I remember the moment I heard this, I recalled one of my favorite childhood books called *The Giving Tree*, written by Shel Silverstein. I knew that whatever I created needed to fit into that theme and take inspiration from the storyline. I had numerous ideas, but due to balancing summer school courses and exams, I decided to choose something smaller in scale and more manageable. This decision led me to create The Giving Tree: A story-based interactive horror game.
- Between **June 2nd and June 6th**, I began planning out the game. I wrote the storyline, planned the interactive elements I wanted to implement, and outlined the series of events I intended for players to experience. Afterward, I created a series of voice line scripts and drafted a template for the map's appearance on paper.
- I officially initiated this project on **June 7th**, after being satisfied with my planning.
- Between **June 7th and June 23rd**, I worked with Unity 3D and C# to implement everything.
- I completed and submitted this project as of **June 24th**.

I am pleased to announce that I have finally achieved what I set out to do. This marks my first time working with Unity 3D, and I genuinely enjoyed the experience. I hope to create many more games in the future, so stay tuned!
